# Step 1.) Account & Access

This step does not use any scripts. We simply point you to the ADNI website and where you can apply for access to the ADNI data set. 


To download the ADNI dataset you first need to register to the [LONI Image & Data Archive (IDA)](https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp), a secure research data repository, and then request access to the ADNI dataset through the submission of an [online application form](https://ida.loni.usc.edu/collaboration/access/appApply.jsp?project=ADNI).
